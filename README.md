The accompanying project files for my talk "Creating Web Applications with React
and Redux" https://www.meetup.com/adelaidejs/events/232880737/. Held at Majoran
Distillery on the 16th of August, 2016.

## Project Strucutre

The code is broken up into modules which match the development stages of the demo
application. Each module can be run individually by replacing the rendered
component in `src/index.js` and running the command `npm start` from the root
directory.

I used Create React App https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app to
get started without having to worry about build configuration. If your're starting
a React project I highly recommend you check it out.
